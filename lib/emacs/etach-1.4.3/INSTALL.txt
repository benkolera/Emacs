Installation instructions for etach:
------------------------------------

Important: Be sure to peruse all of the documentation (.txt) files and
back up your mail files before using etach, especially before using
the detach function.  For example, the file FAQ.txt contains
information necessary to ensure the detach function works properly
with your version of Emacs (look for "rmail-ignored-headers" in the
"PROBLEMS" section of FAQ.txt).

If you're in a hurry, just follow step (1) below and then skip to
"Then..." near the bottom of this file.

1. Put the following into your emacs startup file, e.g., ~/.emacs:

     (load "~/elisp/etach")

   Modify the "~/elisp" part to match the directory in which
   etach.el resides.

2. Optionally, also put one or more of the following into your emacs
   startup file, e.g., ~/.emacs:

     (global-set-key "\C-c\C-f" 'find-file-at-point)
     (global-set-key "\C-c\C-u" 'browse-url-at-point)

     (define-key rmail-mode-map "F" 'mime-forward)
     (define-key rmail-summary-mode-map "F" 'mime-forward)

     (define-key rmail-mode-map "K" 'kill-label-detached)
     (define-key rmail-summary-mode-map "K" 'kill-label-detached)

   These define convenience key sequences for use in RMAIL mode.  The
   first two allow you to use C-c C-f and C-c C-u for more convenient
   visiting and browsing of detached files.  (Put the point on the
   detached file name and type C-c C-f, or keep an eye on your browser
   (Netscape?) window and type C-c C-u.)  The second two allow you to
   use F in place of f for mail forwarding when you want
   message/rfc822 formatting (as you probably do when forwarding mail
   with attachments).  If you get an error message about one of the
   mode-maps, you may need to put (require 'rmail) or (load
   "rmailsum") or (require 'sendmail) ahead of these or similar lines
   (for an alternative, see FAQ.txt).  The third pair allows you to
   type "K" to remove the "detached" attribute from a received mail
   message (this label is set on the current email message when the
   detach function is invoked).

   Of course, you can go further with the conveniences; the
   global-set-key and define-key invocations given above are just a
   few of the possibilities.  For instance, you may find (define-key
   rmail-mode-map "D" 'detach) and/or (define-key
   rmail-summary-mode-map "D" 'detach) to be useful.  Just be sure you
   don't presently use the key sequences originally associated with
   any of these mode/key combinations (check them via C-h k).

3. Optionally, also put one or more of the following into your startup
   file:

     (setq etach-prompt-me-for-file-names t)
     (setq etach-clean-decoded-plain-text t)
     (setq etach-fill-decoded-plain-text t)

   (If you have a recent version of Emacs, you may prefer to use
   custom-set-variables instead.)  There are other customization
   variables you can set.  See the documentation for the variables
   beginning with "etach-" after completing the installation (C-h v
   etach- SPC), or grep for defcustom in etach.el.

Then...

After modifying your startup file you'll need to let Emacs know about
the changes; e.g., do an M-x eval-buffer, or just save the file and
restart emacs.

Please see the file INSTALL-TEST.txt for instructions on testing your
installation.

Please see the file README.txt for features and more information.

Please see the file FAQ.txt for frequently asked questions and more
tips for customizing etach.

Please see the file CHANGELOG.txt for a record of changes from version
to version.

Enjoy!
