Installation test:
------------------

Etach provides several interactive commands, but the three most
important are attach, detach, and mime-forward.  The steps below will
allow you to quickly test all three.  If any fail, please see the file
FAQ.txt and then contact me with the details.

1. Execute the load instruction described in the INSTALL.txt file, or
   reload (or eval-buffer) your startup file, or simply exit and
   restart emacs.

2. Start composing a brief text email message to yourself (via Mail
   mode; e.g., type C-x m, where "C-x" denotes the Ctrl key together
   with the x key).

3. Before sending the message, type

     M-x attach RET

   Note that "M-" denotes the emacs "meta" key (typing the Esc key
   followed by x should work) and "RET" denotes the "Return" or
   "Enter" key.  You will be prompted for a file to attach; type in
   the name of some existing file, then RET.  You should then see the
   file (in encoded form) attached to your message.  Send the message.

4. Now start rmail (M-x rmail RET, or switch to the RMAIL buffer) and
   retrieve your mail (M-x rmail-get-new-mail, or g).  Navigate to the
   new message that you sent to yourself in step (3).

   IMPORTANT: SAVE AND MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR RMAIL FILE(S) BEFORE
   PROCEEDING.  This way you can restore the file(s) if something goes
   awry.

5. After backing up your RMAIL file(s), type

     M-x detach RET

   The file you received as an attachment should now be detached into
   the "detached" subdirectory of your RMAIL working directory
   (possibly with a modified file name).  (If the detach operation did
   not work as expected, please be sure to see the file FAQ.txt.)
   Compare it to the original file you attached with diff or md5sum;
   it should be identical.

6. Now return to the RMAIL buffer and type

     M-x mime-forward RET

   This should act like the usual rmail-forward command, except that
   the forwarded message will be sent as a MIME message/rfc822
   attachment, rather than just inserted as text.  This is useful for
   forwarding mail that contains attachments.
